### Key and Mouse Codes

## Overview
- We do not want to constantly rely on GLFW's key codes
- In case that other OS's do not support GLFW's key codes
- Whereas the way they handle key codes may be different.
- So, for the GameEngine we are going to be creating our own key codes
- Just so we are not dependant on GLFW's key codes, and this allows the engine to be very independent.
